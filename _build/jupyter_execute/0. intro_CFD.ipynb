    "In this course, we focus on the application of **computational techniques** for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly the Navier-Stokes Equations. These computational approaches effectively transform PDEs into linear algebraic equations. Among the various techniques available, such as the Finite Element Method, Finite Difference Method, and Finite Volume Method, our primary emphasis will be on the **Finite Difference Method** and its implementation in Python.\n",
