    "\n",
    "For more computationally intensive programs, the use of built-in Numpy functions can provide an  increase in execution speed many-times over. **Keep in mind, for optimal performance in Python programming, it's essential to substitute for-loops with array operations wherever possible.** As a simple example, consider the following equation:\n",
